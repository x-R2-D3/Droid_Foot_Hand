## Abstract
The goal of this project was to take a traditional wheel appendage and adapt it to be multi-functional as both a wheel and a human-like hand. In this project I choose to reimagine the “foot” of the droid R2-D2, with the intention to 3D print the final product.

Figure 2. This was the test model I had roughly put together to "sketch" out my idea. I used a transparent trapezoid to represent R2-D2's foot shape that I needed to keep the design contained within.

## Introduction and Related Works

I started my process by making a rough mock up of my idea in TinkerCad. I initially had the idea to take this prototype into a CAD program such as AutoCAD or Fusion to further iterate upon but I decided to use Maya instead due to it’s familiarity. In my design, I wanted to keep the same triangular profile as R2-D2’s foot, but I also wanted the foot to be able to “unfold” into a hand. After playing around with my design, I decided to look up some references that were similar to the idea I was going for, and by chance I happened upon someone’s CAD model of the robot WALL.E’s arm. Since the hands for this model were similar to my prototype, I decided to import this model to use as a launching point for my second iteration. I then deconstructed this model and began tweaking various elements, through the manipulation of faces and vertices, to better match my first prototype. I added an additional joint than what was originally in the WALL.E model to better fit with an anatomical human hand.

Figure 3. I am eternally grateful for whomever made the WALL.E hand model I referenced in my final. It sped along the design process exponentially by having some kind of baseline to start from.

## Methodology

There was much time spent on making sure my model didn’t clip through itself while in motion. This involved smoothing edges so they would glide past each other and creating notches in other models where smoothing wasn’t sufficient. My initial plan for this model was for it to be 3D printed, so I tried to keep this in mind when modeling in order to keep the model functional for the physical world. While I was not able to print the model at this time, I am curious to see how it will turn out if I were to try printing it in the future. I started my design with just the center finger, and then proceeded down the finger-joint chain. From here I duplicated the completed finger and tweaked these based on their position in the foot. I then had to design a “pin board” in order to anchor the fingers down and allow for the outer fingers to rotate backwards towards the front of the foot to imitate a human pinky finger and thumb when fully unfolded.

Figure 4. After much tweaking, I finished the middle finger. This was a tedious process of making changes, testing and revising. I wanted to ensure the model had the same limitaions as a human hand while still maintaining its mechanical properties.

Figure 5. I began the process of ploting out where the swiveling finger system would go in the model.

## Result and Future Work
I feel that my final result came out quite nicely and closely replicates what I had initially envisioned, despite having very little reference to rely on outside of the WALL.E hand model downloaded. The fingers themselves turned out much longer than I had expected so this adds a bit of an uncanny effect to the design when used as a hand. The design also left enough room in the center for a motorized wheel mechanism, so I’d be curious to see if this could be feasible for use in a robotics project in the future.

Figure 8. Final model configured into a human hand. Both fingers from the back swivel forward to act as a human pinky and thumb.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, I would love to further explore this prototype to see if it could become a functional replacement for R2-D2’s current foot setup. I would also like to see if this idea could, in the future, function as a basic 3D print or potential robotics project.
